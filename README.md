# 🎓 Student Record Management System (Java)

## 📌 Overview
This project is a **Java-based Student Record Management System** developed as part of **Java Lab Assignment 1** at Netaji Subhas University of Technology (NSUT), Delhi.  
It demonstrates the use of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts, arrays/collections, and menu-driven interaction for managing student records.

## 🛠 Features
- Add new student records (Roll No, Name, Course, Marks).
- Display all student records in a structured format.
- Calculate grades (`A`, `B`, `C`, `D`) based on marks.
- Menu-driven interface for user interaction.
- Data validation for marks (0–100).
